# CV Application
A simple application to build a simple resume. It is very simple at the moment as I am currently learning React and do not want to spend too much time on just one project.
I will come back to this project in future and add more features.

## Features 
- User can get to enter their details and see it all change and display on CV in real-time.
- User can edit their information just before printing or saving their CV.
- User can print or save their CV.

> [!NOTE]
> The website is not responsive currently so it might not work as expected on smaller devices. It will be fixed in future.
